The field of radio interferometry is a way we capture astronomical observations using special equipment called radio interferometers. These radio interferometers are arrays of radio antennas that work together to capture radio waves that represent an astronomical image.\cite{DefinitionInterferometer}\cite{DefinitionInterferometer2} \\
This project creates an imaging pipeline for a specific radio interferometer named TART, which was created by Tim Molteno in Otago University New Zealand. Using Python and CherryPy\cite{Cherrypy} as a web based GUI this project allows users to create images for the TART interferometer in Stellenbosch or New Zealand. The images it creates are of the sky above the interferometer at that time. It also allows the user to input their own custom antenna array layout and test how an image from a telescope such as this would create images of a given sky model that the user chose.
