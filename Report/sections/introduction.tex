The field of radio interferometry entails the astronomical observation of radio celestial emission using special equipment called radio interferometers. Radio interferometers are arrays of radio antennas that work together to capture celestial radio emissions\cite{DefinitionInterferometer}\cite{DefinitionInterferometer2}. \\
In this project we create an imaging pipeline for a specific radio interferometer named TART, which was created by Tim Molteno in Otago University New Zealand. Using Python and CherryPy\cite{Cherrypy} as a web based GUI this project allows users to create images for the TART interferometer in Stellenbosch or New Zealand. It also allows the user to input their own custom antenna array layout and test how an image from a telescope such as this would create images of a given sky model that the user chose.
